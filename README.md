# string-calculator.js

The string-calculator.js exports a method named `add` which is designed to process a string containing numbers separated by delimiters, calculate the sum of the numbers, and handle edge cases like negative numbers and delimiters change(custom delimiter). This calculator supports both single character and multi-character delimiters.
